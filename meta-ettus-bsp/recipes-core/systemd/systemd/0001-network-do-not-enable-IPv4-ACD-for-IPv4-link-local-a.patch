Subject: [PATCH] network: do not enable IPv4 ACD for IPv4 link-local address
 if ACD is disabled explicitly

The commit 1cf4ed142d6c1e2b9dc6a0bc74b6a83ae30b0f8e makes the IPv4 ACD
enabled unconditionally for IPv4 link-local addresses even if users
explicitly disable ACD.

This makes the IPv4 ACD is enabled by default, but honor user setting.

Fixes #22763.

(cherry picked from commit 2859932bd64d61a89f85fa027762bc16961fcf53)
